# sample_code
In this folder I have attached a set of sample codes of previous work I have done in different classes I have taken, below I will explain each one.


TrentonFisherPyExample: a simple Python program that uses an API call to use Nova Scotia crime data and returns the number of incidents based on the location and year that was entered by the user.

TrentonFisherJavaExample: a Java program that checks if a user is a robot by asking for a specific input, if given it well instead create a structure of us and vs based on user input, if user gives the correct input on the last attempt, the program generates a tree out of stars. (*)

TrentonFisherCExample: a simple C program that mimics booking a flight, allowing the user to choose what kind of seat they would like (First Class or Economy) as well as allow the user to choose which seat they would like, at the end of selections the program generates a mock boarding pass based on user choices.

TrentonFisherCppExample: a C++ program that does the calculations of finding the power of a given value as well as the given power (Ex: 4^3) there are hardcoded examples of the program working properly as well as allowing the user to test the program themselves.

TrentonFisherLexerExample: a lexical analyzer implemented using Flex, it processes inputted text (taken from the file test_cases.txt) and converts them into tokens that can be understood and used by a parser.
